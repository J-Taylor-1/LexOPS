\title{Add a split to the data.}
\usage{
split_by(df, var, levels, cond_col = "LexOPS_splitCond", filter = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the IV and strings.}

\item{var}{The column to treat as an independent variable (non-standard evaluation).}

\item{levels}{The boundaries to use as levels of this variable (non-standard evaluation). These should be specified in the form \code{c(1, 3) ~ c(4, 6) ~ c(7 ~ 9)} for numeric variables, and \code{noun ~ verb ~ adjective} for character variables, where levels are separated by the \code{~} operator. Levels must be non-overlapping.}

\item{cond_col}{Prefix with which to name the column where the condition will be stored (default = "LexOPS_splitCond"). Each time
split_by() is run on a dataframe, a new cond_col is added to the data frame, e.g., the first time will add splitCond_A, the second
time will ad split_cond_B, etc. If multiple split_by() functions are used on a data frame (e.g. with pipes), the value of cond_col
must be the same each time the function is called. The default is usually sufficient.}

\item{filter}{Logical. If TRUE, words which fit no conditions are removed.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{df}, with a new column (name defined by \code{cond_col} argument) identifying which level of the IV each string belongs to.
}
\description{
Specifies splits for one IV for a factorial design. Can be called multiple times for multiple splits.

\examples{

# Create 3 levels of syllables, for 1-3, 4-6, and 7-20 syllables
lexops \%>\%
  split_by(Syllables.CMU, 1:3 ~ 4:6 ~ 7:20)

# Same split as above, but supplying boundaries as vectors
lexops \%>\%
  split_by(Syllables.CMU, c(1, 3) ~ c(4, 6) ~ c(7, 20))

# Create 2 levels of position of speech, noun and verb
lexops \%>\%
  split_by(PoS.SUBTLEX_UK, "noun" ~ "verb")

# Perform two splits
